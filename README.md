#  An AI based chatbot design using python
This Streamlit application is designed as a user-friendly interface to interact with a chatbot powered by the Groq API

**How It Works**:

**Step 1: Install Required Tools and Libraries**
Python Installation:from python.org

Install Streamlit:pip install streamlit

Install Groq Python SDK:pip install groq

Verify Installations:python -c "import streamlit, groq"

**Step 2: Set Up the Program**

Save the Code:

Copy the provided Python code into a file named, for example, chatbot_app.py.

Replace API Key:

Update the API_KEY variable in the code with your actual Groq API key:API_KEY = "your_actual_groq_api_key"

Verify Model Name:

Ensure the model name (llama3-70b-8192) is correct. Check Groq documentation or your API dashboard for available models.

API_KEY = "your_actual_groq_api_key"

**Step 3: Run the Program**

Launch the Streamlit App:

In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved and run:

streamlit run chatbot_app.py

Access the App:

A web browser window will open displaying your Streamlit app.
If it doesn’t open automatically, note the URL shown in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:8501) and open it in your browser.

**Step 4: Use the Chatbot**

Enter a Prompt:

Type a question or message in the input box provided.
Generate a Response:

Click the "Send" button.
Wait for the chatbot’s response to appear below the input box.
Experiment:

Adjust the code's parameters (temperature, max_tokens, top_p) to explore different response styles.
Step 5: Debugging and Troubleshooting

**Key Features**:

**Interactive Chat Interface**:

Simple, intuitive design for seamless user interaction.

**Customizable AI Settings**:

Parameters like temperature, max_tokens, and top_p allow users to fine-tune the chatbot's behavior.

**Streaming Support:**

Real-time response display for enhanced interactivity (if enabled).

**Error Resilience**:

Handles API errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages to the user.

**Scalability**:

Easily adaptable for more advanced use cases, such as integrating additional APIs or models.

**Clear Design and Usability**:

Streamlit's layout ensures a clean and engaging user experience, with clear delineation between input, response, and instructions.

**Built-in Prompt Guidance**:

A placeholder in the input box encourages users to craft their questions effectively.

This application demonstrates a practical and accessible way to deploy an AI-powered chatbot using the Groq API in a Streamlit environment.
